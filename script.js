// ============================================================================
/*
TO ADD NEW TIKTOK VIDEOS:

1. Open this file (script.js)
2. Find the 'videoData' array at the top of the file
3. Add a new object to the array with this format:
   {
       title: "Your Video Title",
       description: "Brief description of your video",
       url: "https://www.tiktok.com/@yourusername/video/YOUR_VIDEO_ID",
       date: "2025-01-20", // Use YYYY-MM-DD format
       views: "1.5K" // Use K for thousands, M for millions
   }

4. Save the file and refresh your website

EXAMPLE:
{
    title: "My Latest Dance Video",
    description: "Trying out the newest viral dance trend!",
    url: "https://www.tiktok.com/@yourusername/video/1234567890123456795",
    date: "2025-01-20",
    views: "2.3K"
}

TIPS:
- Always use the full TikTok URL
- Keep descriptions concise but engaging
- Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Views can be formatted as "1.2K", "5.6M", etc.
- Videos will appear in the order they're listed in the array
